## Setting Up Google Tag Manager

To configure Google Tag Manager for this project, please locate the file titled `GTM-NBMX2DWS_workspace<version>.json` in the project's [root directory](https://github.com/WodenWang820118/ng-gtm-site). This file contains the necessary settings for your GTM workspace. You can easily import this configuration into your GTM account. Once imported, select and follow the specific topics relevant to your needs. Also, please refer to the [data layer checker extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/datalayer-checker/ffljdddodmkedhkcjhpmdajhjdbkogke) to inject your own GTM on the GitHub page.
